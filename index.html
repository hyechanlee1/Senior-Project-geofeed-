        <h1>Validation, Adoption and Accuracy of Geofeeds </h1>
        <h3>Project Vision</h3>
        <p>This research aims to investigate the validation, adoption, and accuracy of Geofeeds as a potential solution
            for improving IP geolocation. Geofeeds are self-published lists of IP address ranges linked to geographic
            data, offering the possibility of more accurate location information compared to traditional methods. The
            validation phase will address key questions related to the compliance of Geofeed data with the RFC8805
            standard, the types of errors present in invalidated data, the proportions of these errors, the IP address
            ranges covered by the validated data, and the Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from which invalidated data
            originates. By answering these questions, the research will assess the overall reliability of Geofeed data
            and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        <p>The adoption phase will focus on understanding the current use of Geofeeds in the industry. Key questions
            will explore which IP address ranges are managed and allocated by each Regional Internet Registry (RIR),
            which organizations have published Geofeed data, and the differences in adoption rates between IPv4 and IPv6
            prefixes. Additionally, the research will examine which types of organizations, such as Internet Service
            Providers (ISPs), content providers, and transit providers, are most active in publishing Geofeed data.
            These findings will provide insight into the factors influencing the adoption of Geofeeds and their
            integration into the broader geolocation ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The accuracy testing phase will evaluate the effectiveness of Geofeeds in providing precise IP geolocation
            data. The research will focus on identifying the most effective metrics for assessing accuracy, such as
            round-trip time (RTT) thresholds and geographical distance offsets, and will analyze the distribution of
            inaccuracies across organizationsâ€™ Geofeeds. The accuracy of the information provided in Geofeed data will
            be compared to traditional geolocation methods, determining whether Geofeeds can reduce errors and provide
            more reliable location information. These insights will help guide future geolocation standards and the
            broader adoption of Geofeeds in various industries.</p>
